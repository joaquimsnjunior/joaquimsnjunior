Hi, I'm Joaquim! ðŸ‘‹

I'm the CEO and founder of ScalaCRM, a startup focused on CRM solutions. I'm a fullstack developer, passionate about PHP and the Hyperf framework. On the frontend, I'm a big fan of Next.js, which I use in many of my projects.

Before founding ScalaCRM, I worked on software development projects involving system architecture and API design. I'm also active in the tech community, especially around PHP and modern frameworks.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new technologies, contributing to the developer community, or just hanging out with friends.

Feel free to connect with me here or on other platforms to chat about tech, startups, and programming!
